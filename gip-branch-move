    Usage: gip-branch-move <new-parent> <old-parent>

    Uses "git rebase --onto <new> <old>" to move a branch from one parent to another.

    Git may stop and ask you to fix some "merge conflict" kinds of problems before
    you are allowed to complete the rebase; usually you will do well to
    follow git's advice of "git rebase --continue" after doing those fixes.
    If things go sideways, do "git rebase --abort" so you can start all over.

    After that, if you have been pushing your branch to a remote git server,
    you will want to do a "git merge" so that you can sync your changes with
    your branch's remote; then you can push without any need for "force push".

    After that, use git push to push your branch (or just gip-push-current).
